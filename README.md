Proof-of-concept for skin to view timelens from https://timelens.io/

Hello there,
I have made a proof-of-concept for a vlc skin (with bash-script) to open **one** file with a time timelens-preview:
https://github.com/ericszimmermann/timelens_skin
It's not a very nice skin, because its my first try and I am not so good at graphics.
But maybe someone is interested, so feel free to fork.
